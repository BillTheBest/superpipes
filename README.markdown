# Superpipes

This is a [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/) equivalent built with [Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com/), hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). We built that just in case Y! decides to "sunset" pipes as well...
Also, it's realtime, and can be tweaked in any way you want to fit your needs!
